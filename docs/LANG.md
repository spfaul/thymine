# Thymine-Lang (TL) - Thymine's custom Markdown-inspired markup language!

An example `test.tym` file with everything you need to know can be found [here](https://github.com/t0a5ted/thymine/blob/master/tests/test.tym), because no one enjoys writing docs.

The resulting generated HTML webpage can be found [here](https://github.com/t0a5ted/thymine/blob/master/tests/build/test.html).
To build the `test.tym` file, run `python main.py` in the root project directory.
It will be built with the `debug` template specified in [`templates.json`](https://github.com/t0a5ted/thymine/blob/master/templates.json), which has a sexy [gruvbox](https://s3-alpha.figma.com/hub/file/320830941/3d7b6fb4-1603-46de-b249-8a964036a8c4-cover) theme!

TL's source code can be found [here](https://github.com/t0a5ted/thymine/tree/master/src/lang).
