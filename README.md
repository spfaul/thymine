# thymine

Yet another static blog generator, featuring its own custom markdown-inspired language and build system.
`.tym` Source files are transpiled directly to HTML and can be deployed locally or externaly, because it's literally HTML.

#### Why static?
> because it's easier.

## Features
- [ ] Complete markdown port into thymine language
- [ ] Build and deploy system
- [x] Use CSS to make the websites look decent
- [x] Template files and configs
- [ ] CLI

## Quick Start (requires [python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/))
> Thymine doesn't even have a working alpha yet...
> so don't have high hopes.
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/t0a5ted/thymine.git
> cd thymine
> python3 main.py
```
